Open a Terminal window (ncs 3.1.1.)

Paste this whole thing, You don't actually need the fisrt (remove-Item)line only after the initial build to remove any old stuff when you edit or make changes to the source or .prf, it allows it to startup the build clean.

---- Paste this in terninal------

Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\build_xiao -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

west build -p always -d build_xiao `
  -b xiao_nrf54l15/nrf54l15/cpuapp . -- `
  -DSHIELD=seeed_xiao_round_display `
  -D BOARD_ROOT=C:/ncs/Seeed/platform-seeedboards/zephyr `
  -DSB_CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=n `
  -DCONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=n

west flash -d build_xiao -r openocd

---------END-------

Notes you can flash it anyway that works for you , this is easiest IMO. YMMV 
if you need to use the debugger or Jlink it's a different Flash command.

BTW , doesn't matter if your in the NRF_connect SDK and click build , it does the same thing behind the scene

I added the merged.hex to the root folder if you are super lazy ;-p , just flash that and test your hardware.
