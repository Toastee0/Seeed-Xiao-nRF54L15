# HPF WS2812 Bit-Bang Sample

This sample demonstrates **true bit-banging WS2812 control on the FLPR core** using Nordic's High Performance Framework (HPF). Unlike SPI-based approaches that run on the application core, this provides precise timing control through direct GPIO manipulation on the RISC-V FLPR processor.

## Key Features

- **FLPR Core Execution**: Runs entirely on RISC-V FLPR core for deterministic timing
- **Bit-Banging Control**: Direct GPIO manipulation for precise WS2812 timing:
  - T0H: ~350ns (0 bit high time)  
  - T1H: ~700ns (1 bit high time)
  - T0L: ~800ns (0 bit low time)
  - T1L: ~600ns (1 bit low time)
- **HPF Framework**: Uses Nordic's HPF for optimized FLPR-to-GPIO performance
- **No SPI Dependency**: Pure GPIO timing, no peripheral dependencies

## Hardware Requirements

- nRF54L15-DK development board
- WS2812/NeoPixel LED strip 
- 3.3V to 5V level shifter (recommended)
- External 5V power supply for LED strip

## Wiring

```
nRF54L15-DK     Level Shifter    WS2812 Strip
P2.10 (GPIO)  → LV side       → HV side → DIN
GND           → GND           → GND     → GND  
5V (external) →               → VDD     → 5V
```

## Building

```bash
# Set environment
$env:ZEPHYR_BASE = "C:\ncs\v3.2.0-preview2\zephyr"
$env:ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT = "zephyr" 
$env:ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR = "C:\ncs\toolchains\c1a76fddb2\opt\zephyr-sdk"

# Build for nRF54L15-DK
west build --build-dir build_dk --pristine --board nrf54l15dk/nrf54l15

# Flash both domains (application + FLPR)
west flash --build-dir build_dk
```

## Verification

Confirm FLPR core execution:
```bash
# Check RISC-V toolchain usage
Get-Content build_dk/hpf/CMakeCache.txt | Select-String -Pattern "CMAKE_C_COMPILER"
# Should show: riscv64-zephyr-elf-gcc.exe
```

## Expected Behavior

The sample will cycle through colors on the WS2812 strip with precise timing generated by the FLPR core, demonstrating deterministic real-time LED control.
